# Apple_Stock

This project will aim to pull inventory from Apple's website based on your specified location and tell you which products are currently in stock.

This saves you from clicking through all of the options (RAM, Storage, Color) of Apple products and checking if they are in stock.

The information will be displayed so that you can quickly tell which Apple items are in stock at your Apple Store.
